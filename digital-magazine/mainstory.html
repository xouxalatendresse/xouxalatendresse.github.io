                    <h3>2024 NHL Draft Results</h3>
                    <p>The 2024 NHL Draft was an event to remember, with a mix of expected top picks and surprising late-round steals that could shape the future of the league for years to come. Held in the wild city of Las Vegas, the draft saw teams strategically maneuvering to secure the best talent available.</p>
                    <p>Among the top selections, the first overall pick went to the San Jose Sharks, who selected a highly touted center known for his exceptional playmaking abilities. This young star is expected to make an immediate impact in the NHL, bringing much-needed depth to the Ducks' lineup.</p>

                    <p>Another standout moment of the draft was the trade frenzy that unfolded in the later rounds. Several teams swapped picks and players in a bid to better position themselves for the upcoming season. The New York Rangers, in particular, made headlines with a blockbuster trade that brought in a veteran defenseman, further solidifying their blue line.</p>   
                    <p>In addition to the established prospects, a few under-the-radar players caught the eye of scouts and analysts alike. These late-round picks, often overlooked in favor of bigger names, could prove to be the hidden gems of the draft, bringing unexpected value to their teams in the years to come.</p>
